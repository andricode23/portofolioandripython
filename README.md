CAPSTONE MANAGEPLOYEE

Manageployee is a simple application that can be used by any kind of companies that want to manage their company in simple way. This application will help any employers, resource department and supervisors who want to manage and evaluate their employee. There are 5 main features you currently can use:
1.	 Read: this feature will allows you to read any employee data that is stored in the database
2.	Update: you can update the employee database such as “performa” and “jabatan”
3.	Add: you can add new employee give the detail about them.
4.	Delete: you can delete employee data
5.	Classify: Depending on the kind of value (for this version is employee performance) you can classify certain employee into different data groups.


Note: this is still in version 0.1. So, it is still the main and simple CRUD program. In the future there will be more development such as expanding the database to we can use SQL and Excel data. The classify function will be the main focus in the development since Manageployee app main function is to classify the data. So there will be more development in this part such as we can learn the average day of employee take paid leave, list of employee that is promoted etc.
